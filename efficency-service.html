                  to mitigate harmonic distortion within the power supply. They
                  are a combination of capacitors and reactors designed as per
                  the predominant harmonic present in the supply as well as the
                  Harmonic generating load. The Filter capacity and location of
                  installation is derived after the Harmonic / Power Quality
                  analysis.
